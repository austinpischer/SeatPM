# SeatPM
This is a public repository that allows potential collaborators to
contribute to our project using "git" version control.

The SeatPM device contains two major software components:
1) The microcontroller code (PSoC), and
2) The phone app code (Flutter).

This project structure is reflected in the file structure of this repository.
